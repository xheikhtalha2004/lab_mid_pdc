## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xheikhtalha2004/lab_mid_pdc.git
   cd lab_mid_pdc
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the experiments:**
   ```bash
   python research_paper_experiments.py
   ```

## 📈 Experimental Results

### Numerical Algorithms Scalability

The implementation successfully replicates the research paper's findings:

- **Limited Scalability**: Only 4 out of 6 numerical algorithms show benefits with 2-4 threads
- **GIL Impact**: Performance degrades significantly with more threads due to Python's threading limitations
- **Best Performance**: Molecular Dynamics achieves ~3.18x speedup with 4 threads
- **OMP4Py Overhead**: Negligible (<0.2% difference vs sequential code)

### Key Findings

1. **OMP4Py Correctness**: Issues stem from Python interpreter limitations, not OMP4Py implementation
2. **Non-Numerical Superiority**: Graph processing and text analysis show much better parallel efficiency
3. **GIL Constraints**: Numerical applications limited to small thread counts in Python 3.13
4. **Future Potential**: As Python's free-threading matures, OMP4Py's numerical scalability will improve

## 🔧 Technical Details

### OMP4Py Implementation Patterns

```python
# Parallel for loop with reduction
with omp("parallel for reduction(+:sum_val)"):
    for i in range(num_intervals):
        x = (i + 0.5) * step
        sum_val += 4.0 / (1.0 + x * x)

# Parallel for loop with static scheduling
with omp("parallel for reduction(+:total) schedule(static)"):
    for i in range(num_samples):
        x = a + (b - a) * random.random()
        total += 50 / (np.pi * (2500 * x + 1))
```

### Benchmark Configuration

- **Thread Counts**: 1, 2, 4 threads (matching research constraints)
- **Problem Sizes**: Reduced for reasonable execution time
- **Measurements**: 3 runs per configuration, averaged
- **Timeout Protection**: 60-second limit per test
